    <h2>Gregory</h2>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>My name is Gregory, I live in Spain and I am from Spain but I have my mother's family that are from the United States. I am twenty-two years old, married and sealed to my wife, and I can say that we are happy because of that decision we made. I have been studying Information Technology since I was sixteen and I look forward to continue studying programming and web development so I can one day work doing that. IT is something that calls my attention, I think that technology in general is very useful, specially in the future, but I also like music. I like electronic and rock music because it keeps me active, happy and motivated. I also like sports, more specifically I like playing soccer. I could be hours and hours playing without stopping.</p>
    <p>I have a really busy life at the moment, I am studying this certificate, I have some callings in the Church and I am also currently working at a warehouse of ceramic tiles. I work with the forklift, loading and unloading trailers, preparing orders, etc. My plan is to continue studying programming and web development so I can, at some point, move to the United States and work somewhere with relation to this certificate. It will take years as I continue studying, but it will worth it.</p>
    <p>I got baptized in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saints when I was eight years old, and since then I have been an active member and went to a mission between 2019 and 2021 (yes, during COVID-19). I started my mission in Guatemala City but because of COVID-19, me and all the missionaries that weren't from Guatemala had to return to owr own countries. So I spent eight months on my original mission, two months at home (because of the quarentine) and the rest in Spain.</p>
