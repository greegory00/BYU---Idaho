        Hello! If you are looking for new musical instruments, you are in the right place! Even still, if you want to learn how to play an specific musical instrument or you want to repair yours, you are also in the correct place.
        To start, let us present ourselves. We are an international bussines spread over many countries. Play It! was born in the east of Italy, and currently we are spread all over Europe and also in America, and with the love that we have as a company for the music in general, we are ready to help you with what you want and with what you need. If you live near by one of our central shops, you will have in your disposition all types of musical instruments, such as: string, wind, percussion or electric. You will have the chance to look to screens where you can learn interesting information about the musical instrument you are looking for, and even the basics to learn how to play it.
        But not everything is about buying those instruments. As mentioned before, with us, you can learn how to play and how to use that instrument. How is that performed? We have qualified teachers in our shops. When we have a minimum of customers that want to learn how to play an specific instrument, these teachers will impart classes of one hour three times a week, usually Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, but that schedule can vary depending on the instrument you want to learn to play and depending on where you live.
        Now, if you are interested on fixing an instrument that is broken or old, we also offer repair services. We usually have one workshop if our shop Play It! is in your town, but if that is not the case we are working on building one soon (it is always helpful if you get in contact with us and make us know to speed up the process!). If you ever want to fix your musical instrument, you can always go to the workshop between 07:00 AM and 15:00 PM, drop it there and then they will tell you when will your instrument be fixed, but it is better if you provide your phone number so they can call you.
        In this website, you will be able to access to our services, and if you ever have any questions, you will also have a phone number and a chat in which you can ask for any doubts you have. If you are not able to receive an answer as wanted, you are always welcome to one of our shops close to you and the commercial or the person who is responsable of the shop in that place will be more than pleased to answer your questions.

      <h3>Learning to play an instrument</h3>
      <p>
        Our music classes work as follows: We always start our first class with the most basics aspects of the instrument. We gather in a big circle and the teacher is positioned in a way where everyone can listen to him.
        If you would like to learn more about joining classes with us, don't wait to contact us! We will tell you when will the classes start as soon as possible.

      <h3>Repairing your musical instrument</h3>
      <p>
        If you have an old or broken instrument and you want to repair it, and if you have access to one of our workshops, you can always go and leave it there. If you don't want to go in person you can rather call and ask any questions you have.
        The person in charge of the workshop will talk to you about how much will it cost and how much time will the instrument take to repair.
