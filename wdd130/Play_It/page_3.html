        <p>If you have an old or broken instrument and you want to repair it, and if you have access to one of our workshops, you can always go and leave it there. If you don't want to go in person you can rather call and ask any questions you have. The person in charge of the workshop will talk to you about how much will it cost and how much time will the instrument take to repair. Now, if you are interested on fixing an instrument that is broken or old, we also offer repair services. We usually have one workshop if our shop Play It! is in your town, but if that is not the case we are working on building one soon (it is always helpful if you get in contact with us and make us know to speed up the process!). If you ever want to fix your musical instrument, you can always go to the workshop between 07:00 AM and 15:00 PM, drop it there and then they will tell you when will your instrument be fixed, but it is better if you provide your phone number so they can call you.</p>

        <p>In this website, you will be able to access to our services, and if you ever have any questions, you will also have a phone number and a chat in which you can ask for any doubts you have. If you are not able to receive an answer as wanted, you are always welcome to one of our shops close to you and the commercial or the person who is responsable of the shop in that place will be more than pleased to answer your questions.</p>
