        <p class="p1">Our music classes work as follows: We always start our first class with the most basics aspects of the instrument. We gather in a big circle and the teacher is positioned in a way where everyone can listen to him. If you would like to learn more about joining classes with us, don't wait to contact us! We will tell you when will the classes start as soon as possible.</p>
        <img class="page-2-1" src="images/learn2.jpg" alt="Page 2">
        <p class="p2">As mentioned before, with us, you can learn how to play and how to use that instrument. How is that performed? We have qualified teachers in our shops. When we have a minimum of customers that want to learn how to play an specific instrument, these teachers will impart classes of one hour three times a week, usually Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, but that schedule can vary depending on the instrument you want to learn to play and depending on where you live</p>
